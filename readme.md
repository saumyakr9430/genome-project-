# 🌟 Machine Learning + DSP for Genome Classification 🌟



## 🚀 Project at a Glance
Unlocking genome classification with a **98% accuracy** by blending the power of **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Digital Signal Processing (DSP)**. 🌐

---

## ✨ Highlights

- **Objective:** Classify genome sequences across all taxonomic levels.
- **Innovative Approach:**
  - 🧬 **Windowing Concept**: Divide genome into smaller windows.
  - ⚡ **Fourier Transform**: Extract frequency response from each window.
  - 🔗 **Merging Spectra**: Combine frequency responses coherently.
- **Big Data Project:**
  - Each FASTA file contains genome sequences of length ~16,000.
  - Trained the model on **2,000+ FASTA files**.
- **Machine Learning Models:**
  - 🔍 **SVM** for multi-class classification.
  - 📈 **Linear Regression** for prediction.
- **Result:** Achieved a stellar **98% accuracy**! 🌟

## 🛠️ Methodology



1. **Preprocessing:** Segment genome and apply Fourier Transform.
2. **Frequency Spectrum:** Merge windowed responses for a complete spectrum.
3. **Feature Extraction:** Derive features from the spectrum.
4. **Classification:** Leverage **SVM** and **Linear Regression**.
5. **Evaluation:** 
   - Placeholder for the **Confusion Matrix** 📊.
   - Placeholder for the **ROC Curve** 📈.
   - Achieved **98% accuracy**. 🎉
